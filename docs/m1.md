## 🧩 The Problem

Small businesses often lack **simple, effective tools for daily decisions**.  
Typical pain points include:

- Manual reports in Excel  
- Guesswork when planning inventory  
- Inefficient decision-making without clear trends  

Many non-technical managers struggle to **interpret raw data** and identify actionable insights quickly.

**The situation in Romania is particularly challenging:**

- **72% of companies in Romania** are classified as "low digital intensity" (Romania Insider - "Romanian companies have the lowest level of digitalization among EU enterprises"), therefore using minimal digital technologies for social media, Customer Relationship Management etc.

- A recent study from Alexandru Ioan Cuza University on 50 small and medium-sized enterprises shows that **72% of the employees** think that data is not collected and analyzed automatically with **36% considering that the analysis of the current data does not help in the decision-making process**. (The Impact of Digitalization on Operational Management in Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMES) in the North-East Romania Region)
