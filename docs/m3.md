# M2 - Wireframe and Landing Page

## 📋 Project mockups

We started by creating a [mockup](https://www.figma.com/design/oNSgmFSIyO21TLnMbHxJhs/Untitled?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=v85gkb5QWaCCguQ0-0) for the **[landing page](https://vladcostin4.github.io/analytico-app/)** in Figma and then implemented it using React.

We also created a [product mockup](https://www.figma.com/design/oNSgmFSIyO21TLnMbHxJhs/Untitled?node-id=1-3&p=f&t=cZbJF6ve0jEI1Hlw-0) in Figma that we prototyped (added interactions using the prototype tool in Figma).
