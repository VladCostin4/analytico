# M5 – Validation

The goal of this milestone was to validate user interest in the product by observing early user behavior, without attempting to generate sales.

## 1. User Acquisition

To expose the MVP to potential users, we promoted **Analytico** using **Google Ads**, targeting local business owners and early adopters.

**Campaign results:**

The ads successfully generated a measurable number of visitors to the landing page, enabling early validation of user interest.

## 2. Tracking User Behavior with PostHog

To understand how users interacted on the landing page, we integrated **PostHog** for web and product analytics. This allowed us to track real user behavior and measure engagement.

We analyzed the following funnel:

### Get Full Version Funnel

- Total visitors: 93  
- Clicked "Try Full Version": 15 (~16.13%)  
- Clicked "Start Free Trial": 11 (~11.83%)

A notable percentage of visitors expressed interest in accessing the full version, indicating early validation of the product’s value proposition.

## 3. Analysis and Validation Outcomes

- **Interest validation:** 11.83% of visitors clicked to start a free trial, showing concrete engagement despite no lead collection or sales incentives.

This milestone successfully validated user interest and created a PostHog system for us to further use for the next milestones.
