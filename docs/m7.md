# M7 – Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

## 1. What is our MVP and why we built it

The goal of this milestone was to build a Minimum Viable Product that demonstrates the core value of [Analytico](https://catalinaeln7.github.io/analytico-web-app/): helping small, non-technical business owners turn raw sales data into actionable insights and predictions with minimal effort.

Based on the problem validation, UX research, and market research detailed in the previous milestones, we identified that users value:

- Extremely simple onboarding
- Fast results after uploading data
- Clear insights without complex dashboards
- Guidance instead of raw numbers

Therefore, our MVP focuses only on the core flow that delivers value as fast as possible.

## 2. MVP scope and core features

### 📤 Sales Data Upload (Excel / CSV)

A central upload box where users can upload xlsx or csv files containing sales data.  
After upload, the system processes the file automatically.

**Justification:**  
From the interviews we had with potential customers, we found out that ~80% of businesses already use Excel and that most users are afraid of complex integrations.

---

### 📈 Next Week Predictions

This section displays:

- Overproduction risk
- Sales trends
- Products likely to run out
- Demand estimation for the next week

**Justification:**  
Our interviews showed that prediction and waste reduction are the most painful problems, especially for businesses selling perishable products.  
Instead of historical dashboards, we focused on forward-looking insights, which users found more valuable.

---

### 💬 AI Chat for Data Insights

An interactive chat box where users can ask questions such as: "What should I reduce next week?" or "What are my busiest days?".  
The chat uses ChatGPT tokens and responds only based on the uploaded data.

**Justification:**  
From UX research, we found that users fear charts and dashboards and prefer explanations in natural language instead. Therefore, a chat feels familiar and lowers the learning curve, replacing a complex UI with a conversation, making analytics accessible to non-technical users.

## 3. Why this qualifies as an MVP

Our product meets all three MVP criteria:

- **Delivers enough value to be used**, since it solves real problems validated in M2, provides insights and predictions immediately after data upload and requires no setup or technical knowledge
- **Shows future potential**, since it contains AI-powered analysis and has the possibility to extend to more reports, alerts, and integrations.
- **Creates a feedback loop**, using the users questions in chat to reveal their real needs. Also upload behaviour shows what data formats users rely on.

## 4. Early validation assumptions tested with the MVP

This MVP allows us to validate whether:

- Are users willing to upload their real sales data?
- Do they understand insights without explanations?
- Do they ask questions in the chat?
- Do they find predictions useful?
- Would they pay to continue using it?

## 6. Conclusion

The Analytico MVP is a justified, research-driven prototype that directly reflects customer discovery insights, UX findings and personas.  
It is not a finished product, but it successfully demonstrates the problem, the solution and the business opportunity.
