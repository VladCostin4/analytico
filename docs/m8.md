## 1. User Acquisition

We promoted Analytico using Google Ads to reach local business owners and other potential early adopters.

**Campaign results:**

- Impressions: 1227
- Clicks: 40 (click-through rate ~3.26%)

The ads reached our target audience, generating a measurable number of visitors to the MVP landing page.

## 2. Tracking User Behavior with PostHog

To measure how visitors interacted with the MVP, we integrated PostHog, which tracked two main funnels:

### Funnel 1: Get Full Version Funnel

- Total visitors: 93
- Clicked "Try Full Version": 15 (~16.13%)
- Clicked "Start Free Trial": 11 (~11.83%)

A significant portion of users who visited the page showed interest in trying the full version, indicating early willingness to engage with the product.

### Funnel 2: Using Demo Funnel

- Total visitors: 93
- Clicked "Demo" button: 27 (~29.03%)
- Uploaded a file successfully: 1
- Sent a message in the chat: 1

Users successfully uploaded sales data and interacted with the chat, demonstrating that the core MVP features are understood and usable.  
However, the small amount of questions asked in chat led to the addition of some suggestions for questions to ask about the reports.

## 3. Analysis

- **Interest in full version:** 11.83% of visitors clicked to start a free trial, showing concrete engagement.
- **Core MVP usage:** Uploading a file and using the chat indicates the predictive insights and AI feature are attractive.
- **User feedback potential:** Even without payments, these interactions are strong signals for willingness to try and potentially pay in future iterations.
